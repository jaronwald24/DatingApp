This project was created by Justin Aronwald and Logan Dracos

The additional features include:

- Extra stylistic features that were unnecessary
    - Including using various modals
- Additional fields to add instagram username, which links to the user's instagram account
- Suprise me feature which gets all of the users in your gender preferences and you are there gender preference, and navigates to a profile randomly selected
- Displaying both the search results as well as users that fall in the filter range
- Compliments:
    - Has ability to send quick, generated compliments to another user from homepage
    - Uses fetch API to do so without refreshing the screen
    - Styled effectively
    - Can view compliments on your profile page
    - Uses fetch API to delete compliments in the modal, so that it doesn't refresh everytime
- Proposals:
    - Added the ability for users to select a restaruant cuisine when making a proposal
        - Ensured that each restaurant had the maximum amount of tables, rather than just 1 restaurant
    - Went above and beyond on styling and presentation of proposals, ensuring each type of proposal is properly put into its own section
    - Overflow of many proposals handled

For optimal viewing of users, we have many filler users and 5 custom users with more fulfilled profiles, with every combination of age preference. When testing I used a profile of age about 20 with preferences 18-30.

- AI was used very insignificantly, with nothing of large block code or worth sharing in here. It was mainly used to help debug, and so it would only affect syntaxical errors.
